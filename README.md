# easynetworkmonitor
Simple Network Monitor and Packet Sniffer built with .net winforms, before using make sure you install https://nmap.org/npcap/

Application will display on the map all opened TCP connections and their GEO origin, and process information that generated the connection. Apart from this,still under development is packet sniffer. 
This is my hobby project, and feel free to use it. It's still under development and needs more improvment.
